# Isochronmap Generator

> Featuring an example for the region Tübingen, Germany and a Regressor

An ischron map is an elegant tool to visualize how long one would travel starting from an origin to every sorounding destinations. 
It is helpfull to grasp how travel time changes by means of transportation but can also be used to see how transportation time changes during different times of day.
This project features a full pipline to collect the data, visualize the data points, plot the isochronmap and additionally train a regression model for aquired data.
In the following and the source code we use this pipeline on the region Tübingen Germany, but one can use this pipeline on any region.

## Misc
This project was part of the Data Literacy lecture WS 21/22 held by ![Prof. Henning][prof]. 
It includes parts of the lecture in a practical fashion, such as data collection, data processing, data visualisation, data intpretation, data estimation and hypothesis testing.
Big thanks to Nicholas Krämer for creating the ![Tueplots][tueplots] libary, which helps to find better matplotlib settings.  
Feel free to fork this is a non commercial students project.
